# Advent of Code 

Going to try keeping a running repo of each year's AoC activities.

## 2023

2023 was my first year participating in Advent of Code. I used it primarily as an opportunity to dust off my C++ skills.
If I had extra time (which was rare), I'd try reimplementing some solutions using a different language (e.g. Rust, C#, Typescript).
